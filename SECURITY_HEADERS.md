🛡️ Security Headers Policy — CYBERDUDEBIVASH®

CYBERDUDEBIVASH® applies modern web security headers to protect its platforms, users, and data against common web-based attacks.

This document defines the recommended and enforced HTTP security headers for the CYBERDUDEBIVASH® enterprise website and associated web platforms.

🎯 Objectives

The purpose of implementing security headers is to:

Reduce exposure to client-side attacks

Enforce secure browser behavior

Protect against injection and framing attacks

Strengthen transport-layer security

Improve trust and compliance posture

🔐 Enforced Security Headers

The following headers are recommended and enforced across CYBERDUDEBIVASH® web properties where applicable.

1️⃣ Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

Ensures all communication occurs over HTTPS.

Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload


Purpose:

Prevents protocol downgrade attacks

Enforces HTTPS-only access

Required for preload eligibility

2️⃣ Content-Security-Policy (CSP)

Restricts the sources from which content can be loaded.

Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self';
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  img-src 'self' data:;
  font-src 'self';
  connect-src 'self';
  frame-ancestors 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
  object-src 'none';


Purpose:

Mitigates XSS attacks

Prevents malicious script execution

Blocks framing and clickjacking

CSP may be adjusted to allow trusted third-party services if required.

3️⃣ X-Content-Type-Options
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff


Purpose:

Prevents MIME-type sniffing

Reduces risk of drive-by downloads

4️⃣ X-Frame-Options
X-Frame-Options: DENY


Purpose:

Prevents clickjacking

Disallows site embedding in iframes

5️⃣ Referrer-Policy
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin


Purpose:

Limits referrer data leakage

Protects sensitive URL information

6️⃣ Permissions-Policy
Permissions-Policy:
  accelerometer=(),
  camera=(),
  geolocation=(),
  gyroscope=(),
  magnetometer=(),
  microphone=(),
  payment=(),
  usb=()


Purpose:

Restricts access to powerful browser APIs

Reduces privacy and security risks

7️⃣ X-XSS-Protection (Legacy)
X-XSS-Protection: 0


Purpose:

Disables deprecated browser XSS filters

Avoids unintended behavior in modern browsers

☁️ Cloudflare Implementation (Recommended)

CYBERDUDEBIVASH® deploys its website using Cloudflare Pages, where these headers are enforced via:

Cloudflare Security settings

HTTP Response Header Rules

Edge-level enforcement

This ensures:

Global consistency

Zero-trust edge protection

Automatic HTTPS handling

🔍 Testing & Validation

Security headers are regularly validated using:

Browser developer tools

Online scanners (e.g., securityheaders.com)

Manual inspection during security reviews

Adjustments are made as platform requirements evolve.

⚠️ Exceptions & Compatibility

Some legacy browsers or third-party integrations may require temporary exceptions.
Any such exceptions must be documented and reviewed for security impact.

🔄 Policy Updates

This Security Headers Policy may be updated to reflect:

New browser security standards

Emerging threats

Platform architecture changes

Compliance requirements

Updates are applied without prior notice where necessary for security.
